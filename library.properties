sentence=PID controller with Stochastic Gradient Descent
paragraph=A PID controller with Stochastic Gradient Descent seeks to keep some input variable close to a desired setpoint by adjusting an output. The way in which it does this can be 'tuned' by adjusting three parameters (P,I,D).  The P/I/D parameters are learned through Stochastic Gradient Descent, a way of reinforcement learning.
